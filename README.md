# Ubud

A totally offline scriptwriting software that is free and beautiful.

## Installation

For now this app can only be run on macOS El Capitan (others are not tested). In the future, this app will be packaged to separate installers for Windows (min 8.1) and macOS (min Mavericks).

From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ianadiwibowo/ubud

# Go into the repository
cd ubud

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm start
```

## Why Ubud was Created?

Because we, film screenplay writers (especially indie ones), are poor while the industry standard is the expensive Final Draft. And we love to write offline (like, in the middle of a small cabin in the woods) with desktop app and not inside a browser which needs online connection.

There was free and good Celtx, but after version 2.9.7 they ceased support for their offline app and move completely to the cloud. Other good scriptwriting desktop apps are available only to macOS while some of us are Windows users.

So we need a free and good scriptwriting software which is a completely offline desktop app and has import/export capability to Final Draft format. That's Ubud.
